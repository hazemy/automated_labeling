function [idx, insert] = findRow(M, row)

% FINDROW Finds a given row in an ordered matrix.
%
%    idx = findRow(M, r) returns an index idx such that M(idx, :) == r, if it
%      is possible, otherwise idx == 0. The rows of the matrix M are supposed
%      to be lexicographically ordered. Running time is O(log n) where n is the
%      number of rows in the matrix.
%
%    [idx, insert] = findRow(M, r) moreover returns the index of the row where
%      r should be insered to keep M lexicographically sorted, if the row is not
%      in M. Otherwise, insert == 0.
